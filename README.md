# Netlist Visualizer and Validator

A proof-of-concept web application that allows users to upload and visualize electronic netlists as interactive circuit graphs. The application also performs basic validation and displays results per submission.

## üê≥ Deployment

The project is containerized and ready for cloud deployment (e.g. AWS ECS, EC2, or similar). A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are included to build and run both frontend and backend services locally or in the cloud.

```
# From root
docker-compose up --build
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Upload Netlists**: Users can submit netlists in a custom JSON format.
- ‚úÖ **Visualize Circuits**: Netlists are rendered as interactive component-level graphs using SVG.
- ‚úÖ **Validate Submissions**: Enforces structural rules (e.g. non-empty names, GND connectivity).
- ‚úÖ **Persistent Storage**: Netlists and results are stored in a MongoDB database.

## üß† Design choices

- FastAPI offers modern async Python performance with clear request validation.

- Validation rules are defined and enforced server-side to ensure consistency and security.

- Validation rules are easy to extend.  Just create a generator that satisfies the `NetlistRule` protocol and register it in `netlist_vis_backend/rules.py`.

- Exposes clean JSON-based REST APIs for netlist submission, retrieval, and validation results.

### üöß Remaining work

#### üß≠ Improved Graph Layout

While the graph is rendered successfully using JointJS, it currently uses a naive layout. JointJS provides the @joint/layout-directed-graph package to support automatic, directed layouts ‚Äî ideal for visualizing circuit topologies. I explored this option, but due to time constraints, I was unable to fully integrate it. Adding this feature would significantly improve readability for larger or more complex netlists.

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Interactive Editing

This proof-of-concept focuses on visualization rather than editing. If future use cases require users to interactively build or modify netlists via the UI, I recommend considering JointJS+. It offers robust tools for building interactive diagram editors, including drag-and-drop components, link editing, and undo/redo functionality ‚Äî features that would be complex and time-consuming to implement from scratch.
